\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Canadian space robotics has made significant contributions to the development and maintenance of the International Space Station (ISS) in the past with the Canadarm. Currently, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is planning on supporting the ISS until 2024 with the Canadarm2\cite{RFP}, and is actively working with international groups on the next generation of space exploration. 

In response to MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.'s (MDA's) Request for Proposa\cite{RFP} for ``a next generation robotic system that is multi-purpose, robust and enables Canada and other nations to explore space"\cite{RFP}, this report outlines the operations aspect of the proposed system. \Cref{concept} provides information on the concept of the proposed system in a high-level manner. \Cref{MLBD} will illustrate the Mission-Level Block Diagram, and \Cref{scenarios} will show the Operation Scenarios of the mission.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Concept of Proposed System}
\label{concept}
In this section, the background, objectives, and scope of the project are discussed. Next, different operational tradeoffs are compared, followed by a description of the operational policies and constraints that are applicable to the system. Afterwards, a more detailed description of the proposed system is given, including the operational environment and its characteristics, functions, operational risk factors, performance characteristics, and quality attributes of the system. Lastly, the different modes of operation and the user classes involved in the system are listed.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Background}
\label{background}
According to the International Space Exploration Consultation Group (ISECG), the human-robot exploration of Mars is the next ultimate step in space exploration.\cite{RFP} However, revisiting the Moon and exploring nearby asteroids will serve as a transition phase to Mars. 

Most countries currently involved in space exploration have their individual objectives to pursue. The European Space Agency (ESA) is interested in conducting sample return missions on Phobos or the Moon, and they are currently working on the Service Module (SM) for the new Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). Moreover, the Russian Space Agency (RSA), and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) wants to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars. India has formed relationships with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) regarding Mars exploration, while China is starting to show interest in human-robotic missions beyond their developing Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) station.\cite{RFP}

The United States of America (USA) is in the process of developing the Orion MPCV, and is actively working on the new Space Launch System (SLS). Uses of these advanced technologies include future human-robotics Mars missions, and Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM). In addition, private companies in the USA such as SpaceX and Boeing are assisting in the development of vehicles that take crew beyond LEO.\cite{RFP}

To facilitate the various missions and objectives of these different nations, a lunar Outpost stationed at Earth-Moon Lagrange point 2 (EML2) was recently proposed. The Outpost would serve as a common platform for future human-robotic missions, and serve as a staging area to Lagrange points, the lunar surface, or Mars.\cite{RFP}

As human-robotic missions get farther away from Earth, the amount of mass being carried becomes more critical. Hence, Canada's next generation of space robotics needs to prove itself useful enough to be taken as a key component of the lunar Outpost.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Goals and Objectives}
\label{goals}
On the Outpost, Canada's next generation robotic system will play an important role, facilitating the functions of crew members and space vehicles. The key qualitative goals of this system include versatility, adaptability, advanced mobility and dexterity, as well as the ability to be upgradeable.\cite{RFP} A multi-purpose system like this will assist Canada and other nations to expand and develop their space exploration programs. 

The design of a space robotic system will revolve around objectives of the mission. The first objective includes supporting tasks involving the following five key operations\cite{RFP} :
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Outpost Reconfiguration}
\item{Outpost Inspection, Maintenance and Repair}
\item{Capture and Berthing of visiting vehicles}
\item{EVA transport}
\item{Contingency Operations}
\end{enumerate}

Another objective is staying within the constraints defined in the RFP (further discussed in \Cref{constraints}), with a particular focus on the maximum mass and volume. The third objective would be to meet the quantitative requirements laid out in the RFP.\cite{RFP} 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\subsection{Scope}
\label{scope}
The operational scope of this mission is primarily based around the Outpost, and revolves around the five key operations listed in \Cref{goals}. Away from the Outpost, the system may be responsible for directly assisting with tasks involving ARM, as well as human-robotic missions on the Mars or lunar surfaces. 

The system is not responsible for long-distance transportation, such as the launch from Earth to the Outpost, and any other long-distance travel the system may undergo. Moreover, an independent communication system, which communicates directly to ground station, is also out of the scope of this mission, as all of the communications will be routed through the Outpost. In addition, the system is not responsible for developing its own source of power, as the Outpost will be providing the required power for the system to operate.

Note that even though the focus of the discussion above is solely around the Outpost, the system will be ideally designed to work in a similar fashion on other vehicles for future missions, and will have similar power and communication requirements.

The mission can be further scoped by identifying the various stakeholders surrounding the project. Note that these stakeholders are clumped into general categories, as identifying each specific person/organization involved would be redundant.

\Cref{stakeholders} describes the major stakeholders and how they are connected to the mission.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Trade-offs}
\label{tradeoffs}
There are three major trade-offs identified at the mission-level:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Capability of achieving the stretch requirements}\\
Due to differences in operational environment between the Outpost and lunar and Mars surfaces which are compared in \Cref{env_comp} below, the capability of achieving stretch requirements will have major impacts to system designs, mission functions and performance.  For example, Canadarm2 is incapable of operating on the surface of the Earth since it cannot support it's own weight.\cite{CADR1} Therefore, the system's capability of achieving the stretch requirements is a major trade-off that needs to be decided at this stage. \Cref{stretch} below demonstrates the wide differences of operational scenarios possible.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of Operation Environments on EML2, Lunar and Mars Surface}
\label{env_comp}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
                   	&   \textbf{EML2}	&	\textbf{Lunar Surface}\cite{moonfacts}  &   \textbf{Mars Surface}\cite{mars}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Gravity}	&   ~0			&	\SI{1.622}{\m\per\square\s}    		&   \SI{3.711}{\m\per\square\s}		\\\hline
\textbf{Temperature Range}	&	\SI{-100}{\celsius}(TBC)	&	\SI{-153}{\celsius}-\SI{-123}{\celsius}	&	\SI{-153}{\celsius}-\SI{20}{\celsius}	\\\hline
\textbf{Atmosphere}	&	Vacuum	&	Vacuum	&	Mostly CO$_2$     \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Trade Study for Stretch Requirements}
\label{stretch}
\begin{tabular}{|P{3cm}|P{4.3cm}|P{4.3cm}|l|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{A: Focus on Outpost operation}	&	\textbf{B: Capable of Stretch Requirements}	&	\textbf{Preferred}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Mission Complexity}	&	\textbf{Low}: operations focused on Outpost, consistent operational environment	&	\textbf{Very high}: operating under very different operational environments (\Cref{env_comp})	&	\textbf{A}	\\\hline
\textbf{Multi-purpose}	&	\textbf{Medium}: capable of performing key operations, capable of contingency operations	&	\textbf{High}: capable of tasks required in stretch requirement	&	\textbf{B}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Even though meeting the stretch requirements would be desirable, the complexity added could be detrimental to the mission's success. In the RFP, the system's key operations are mainly focused on the Outpost\cite{RFP}, so the design of the system should be centered around the key operations performed at the Outpost.}
\item{\textbf{System's level of autonomy}\\
It is stated in the RFP that ``...resources are dedicated towards number of crew, life support systems and mission duration. Therefore, Canada's next generation robotic system needs to `pay its way' -- supplant or replace functions performed by a space vehicle or crew member."\cite{RFP} An autonomous system would reduce the crew's workload, and the system's level of autonomy is a major factor that would affect the functions, performance, complexity, and safety of the system.\cite{rob_sys}\cite{safety_issues} Thus, this is a trade-off that needs to be decided at this level.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Trade Study for Level of Autonomy}
\begin{tabular}{|P{2.2cm}|P{3.5cm}|P{3.5cm}|P{3.5cm}|l|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{A: Fully Manual}	&	\textbf{B: Autonomous for simple tasks}&	\textbf{C: Fully Autonomous}	&	\textbf{Preferred}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Complexity}	&	\textbf{Low/Medium}: easy to develop, existing operation experience\cite{ISS_ass}	&	\textbf{Medium}: there are existing autonomous operations\cite{ISS_ass}&	\textbf{Very high}: software development needed, technology hard to achieve\cite{rob_sys}	&	\textbf{A, B}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Risk}	&	\textbf{Low}: operation is fully monitored	&	\textbf{Medium}: autonomous operation for simple tasks, reduce needs of EVA\cite{rob_sys}&	\textbf{High}: the operation could be under risk of software and component malfunctions\cite{safety_issues}	&	\textbf{A, B}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operation Time}	&	\textbf{Medium}: requires crew or ground control, signal delay from ground control	&	\textbf{Medium/Low}: operate while crew at rest, less EVA	&	\textbf{Low}: no human input required, able to operate continuous hours	&	\textbf{B, C}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
A fully autonomous system would be ideal for space exploration, since it would have high capabilities, and save the Outpost crew time.\cite{rob_sys} However, there are still technical, computational, and safety challenges to overcome before achieving full autonomy. With the current technology available, and operation experience, it is decided that the system should autonomously perform simpler tasks such as inspection. This will allow the system to perform better with relatively lower risk when compared to a fully autonomous system.}
\item{\textbf{System's mobility and way of moving during its operation at the Outpost}
The system's mobility is a major aspect that is addressed in the RFP.\cite{RFP} The function and performance of the system will differ with its mobility options, as each method has a different complexity. A system may be completely mobile and move on its own via wheels or propulsion, or it may be connected to various structures via rails or grapple fixture.

For example, the Canadarm2 achieves mobility by moving the ends of the arm between several prefixed points, and that decision drives the interface definition.\cite{ISS_ass} 

The two options will produce systems with different functions. Thus, a trade study was conducted, detailed in \Cref{trade_mobility} below.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Trade Study for Mobility Options}
\label{trade_mobility}
\begin{tabular}{|P{3cm}|P{5cm}|P{5cm}|l|}
\hline
	&	\textbf{A: 'Completely Mobile'}	&	\textbf{B: 'Connected'}	&	\textbf{Preferred}	\\\hhline{|=|=|=|=|}
\textbf{Mobility}	&	\textbf{High}: the system may navigate beyond the Outpost	&	\textbf{Medium}: the range of the system is limited to the Outpost	&	\textbf{A}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operational Risk}	&	\textbf{High}: since the system is not fixed to the Outpost, there exists a possibility where the system malfunctions and has to be recovered; if a portion of the mobility component is damaged, system may be unable to navigate, increasing the risk of mission failures	&	\textbf{Low}: system can be retrieved easily as it is attached to Outpost; if a portion of the mobility component, the system can still navigate the Outpost using different nodes, the increase in risk would be lower.\cite{MDA_Carm2}	&	\textbf{B}	\\\hline
\textbf{Operational Complexity}	&	\textbf{High}:  system must have its own mobility mechanism that requires its own power to move by itself. Including wheels, legs, or engines would increase the system's complexity\cite{safety_issues} 	&	\textbf{Low}: system can use power from Outpost to operate as they are attached.\cite{IEEE_Carm}	&	\textbf{B}	\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
A completely mobile system has navigation advantages and can reach places that a connected system cannot. However, it also has disadvantages due to the additional risk and complexity. A system that is attached to the Outpost can still complete missions such as inspection, maintenance, and repair without significant disadvantages. From the trade study, it appears that a connected system is the safer option.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Deployment (1.0)}\\
The system will be launched in 6 stages, as shown in \Cref{deploy}. The parts will be removed from transport vehicle and positioned in the correct orientation. They are then connected to each other and tested for functionality before being returned to standby state to await instructions.\\

\textbf{Key Operations (2.0)}\\
The system has five key operations, as discussed in \Cref{goals} and shown in \Cref{FFBD}. Each of these operations are independent, and will be explained below.

\textbf{Outpost Reconfiguration (2.1)}\\
There are five general stages involved in this specific operation. First the target object is identified and attached to the system according to the command signal from the Outpost. Next the system will assist the target object to detach from the Outpost and be transported to its new position. The connection process at the new location will be supported by the system, before it detaches from the target object. Finally, the system will return to its standby state.

\textbf{Outpost Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (2.2)}\\
The system will be performing this function for a majority of the time on the Outpost. It will constantly maneuver around the Outpost, inspecting the various components of the individual modules while sending continuous video feedback to the Outpost crew and ground control. These user classes will be able to identify any faulty components either through inspection, or through the data received from these components. Once a faulty component is identified, the system will receive commands to detach the component through a standard procedure. In special cases, manual control can be used to carry out this procedure. Once the faulty component is disposed of, the system will retrieve the replacement component, and install it. Afterwards, the system will continue its inspection procedures.

\textbf{Capture and Berthing of Visiting Vehicles (2.3)}\\
This operation is similar to the reconfiguration explained in 2.2. First the system will carefully approach the visiting vehicle and attach to the designated capture point. The system will then help transfer the visiting vehicle to its docking location. Next the system will assist with the connection process,  and help adjust the visiting vehicle to the proper orientation and position. Once the vehicle has been properly docked to the Outpost, the system will detach itself and return to its standby state.

\textbf{EVA Transport (2.4)}\\
This operation will begin with the system approaching the starting destination of astronaut performing the EVA. The astronaut will then attach to the system (via hand or foot fixtures, tethers, etc.). The system will help transport the attached astronaut to the desired location, where it will remain in proximity to the astronaut, supporting with tasks as required. Next the system will transport the astronaut to additional sites, as necessary
until the EVA operation has been completed. Finally, the system will wait for the astronaut to detach before returning back to the standby state.

\textbf{Contingency Operations (2.5)}\\
The scenario of contingency operations largely depends on the specific situation of the contingency, therefore only a brief functional flow block diagram is provided for this operation. Some general steps include receiving commands from the Outpost crew or Ground Control based on the situation. Assisting in resolving the contingency situation according to the commands and returning to the standby state after the issue has been resolved.\\

\textbf{Future Missions (3.0)}\\
The system could also be customized to fit requirements of future missions. Below are three examples of potential future missions and how the system can be customized to perform such missions.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Asteroid Capture}: System could be mounted onto another spacecraft and fitted with additional mechanisms to locate and capture asteroids}
\item{\textbf{Lunar Surface}: System could be relocated to lunar surface by another spacecraft to support logistics handling on Moon}
\item{\textbf{Mars Surface}: System could be relocated to Mars surface to assist in construction of Mars Outpost and possibly capture of incoming spacecraft for safe landings}
\end{itemize}
